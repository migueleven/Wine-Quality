# Wine Quality Analysis 🍷

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties. By leveraging data science techniques such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning, we seek to uncover insights and build predictive models to classify wine quality.

---

## Goals
- Understand the key factors influencing wine quality.
- Predict wine quality using supervised and unsupervised machine learning.
- Compare different modeling approaches to identify the best-performing method.
- Provide actionable insights for wine producers and researchers.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- **Features**: 
  - 11 physicochemical properties of wine (e.g., alcohol, pH, citric acid).
  - Target variable: `quality` (integer from 3 to 8).

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Normalize features to ensure consistent scaling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize distributions and relationships between features.
   - Identify correlations and key predictors of wine quality.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Use inferential statistics to validate findings from the EDA.

4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Supervised Learning: Train classification models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
   - Unsupervised Learning: Apply clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to explore patterns in the data.

5. **Results and Insights**:
   - Summarize findings and compare model performance.
   - Highlight key factors driving wine quality.
